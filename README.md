## 💼 Portfolio using React.js, Vite and Styled-Components (Update 2025!)

Hello! This is my personal portfolio built with **React.js** and **Vite**.

This repository contains my portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects and experience. It uses modern frontend tools like Styled-Components, React Awesome Reveal, and is fully responsive. Form submissions are powered by EmailJS and configured via environment variables.

> Originally built with CRA and **migrated to Vite in 2025** for improved speed, modern build tools, and developer experience.
